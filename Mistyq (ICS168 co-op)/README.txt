Mistyq is a 2-player co-op game where 2 players each control a mage that can cast elemental spells; one player casts fire spells, while the other casts water spells.
Your goal is to get to the end of each level using your magical powers and cooperative abilities.

Our main goal design-wise was to provide interesting ways for 2 players to work together using what they each have.
Since they have different spells, each player needs each other in order to progress through the levels.

Programming-wise, we mainly tried to implement the foundation of the game's mechanics so that creating levels would be easy.
As much as we managed this, we were able to get in a tutorial level and only 2 extra levels.
A 3rd level we'd thought of didn't make it in because a rabid ostrich broke into our apartment and ate the USB drive with the 3rd level.
Just kidding, it was because of time constraints.



Each player can:

- Move (tank controls; move forward/backward with up/down arrow keys or WS keys, rotate left or right with left/right arrow keys or AD keys)
- Jump (using space bar)
- Use spell (with K key)
- Pick up and put down the other player (with F key)
- Mute/unmute the music (with M key)
